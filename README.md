Personal website made from scratch using Reactjs.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. 

Since github says, user pages must be built from the master branch, the build is present in master while the react code can be found in folder 'react_code'.
